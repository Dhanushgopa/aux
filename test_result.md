# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

GET /api/products/{product_id} returns a single product by ID and handles invalid IDs properly. POST /api/products creates new products with all fields. PUT /api/products/{product_id} updates products correctly and preserves unchanged fields. DELETE /api/products/{product_id} removes products from the database. All endpoints return appropriate status codes and data structures."

Products can be created and updated with the new fields. GET endpoints return products with the new fields properly structured. The material_details object correctly contains material, gemstones, weight, and origin fields as expected."

The endpoint is idempotent and returns 'Sample data already exists' on subsequent calls, preventing data duplication."

        agent: "testing"
        comment: "Tested enhanced sample data initialization with new fields. All 8 products now include model_image_url and material_details fields. The material_details structure correctly contains material (e.g., 18k Gold, Sterling Silver), gemstones, weight (in grams), and origin information. The endpoint properly updates existing products with new fields if they don't have them and doesn't duplicate data on multiple calls."
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "Verified that the sample data initialization endpoint creates products with the exact matching model images. Tested by first deleting all products and then calling the init-data endpoint. All 8 expected products were created with both image_url and model_image_url fields. The model images are different from the product images, allowing for the hover effect to work correctly. All products have the expected material_details structure with material, gemstones, weight, and origin information."
